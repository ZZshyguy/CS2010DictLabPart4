DICTIONARY PART 4
This program will create a dictionary of words (implemented as CLASS) found in a file.
To see alternate GetNextWord or the insert function just uncomment them in the main and comment out the alternative.
The formatting for the alt GetNextWord is horrendous but i'm too lazy to fix it.

To compile, type:	make
To run type:            ./DICTIONARY
To input a file type:   ./DICTIONARY < test
where test is the file with your input
